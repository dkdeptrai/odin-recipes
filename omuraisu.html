    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p><strong>Prep:</strong> 5 mins</p>
    <p><strong>Cook:</strong> 15 mins</p>
    <p><strong>Servings:</strong> 1</p>
    <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 1 serving</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cooked rice or brown rice</li>
        <li>2 thin slices cooked ham, cubed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 slice processed cheese food (such as Velveeta) (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Add the cooked rice, 2 tablespoons ketchup, ham, and cheese, if using. Cook and stir until the ingredients are well combined and heated through, about 8 minutes. Scoop the mixture onto a serving bowl and shape into an oval.</li>

        <li>In a bowl, beat eggs and salt and pepper. Heat a small skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat. Add egg mixture; cook over medium heat. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. Use a spatula to gently fold the eggs into a cocoon shape. When eggs are completely set, remove from the heat.</li>

        <li>Place the omelet on top of the rice and run a knife length-wise through the top layer of the omelet. It should open like a butterfly and drape over the rice. Top with the final tablespoon of ketchup and a sprinkle of parsley.</li>
    </ol>
